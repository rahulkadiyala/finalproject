# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong With A Twist

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In my game, every time the ball hits a paddle it will change in size. The size of the paddle will be random, it could be tiny, large or it won't change size. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make sure the game works before adding any new features to it first. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can make it so that the paddles randomize every time the ball hits one. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope my game will randomize the size of the "paddles" correctly and I hope it changes to a different size each time without it ever repeating more than twice.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Since I am working alone I would have to do everything. The first step for me is to learn how to write the code for pong. Then I'll make sure it works without any errors and after that I can hopefully figure out how to randomize the size of the paddles and maybe even the ball. To learn how to write the code for pong I would use the resources in canvas and I will probably use google for some help after writing the basic code.
